Also, why is everything on sale on there all the time?). Here’s a list of courses that I have actually done and I found to be really good.\nAndrew Ng CS229 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599) (the OG ones with the blue board!)\nStanford CS231N (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)\nCompanion Videos to “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi7lACKOUao&list=PLsXu9MHQGs8df5A4PzQGw-kfviylC-R9b)\nStanford CS224U (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ_Jrc_nRJY&list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20)\nHarvard’s Abstract Algebra (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLelIK3uylPMGzHBuR3hLMHrYfMqWWsmx5)\nMIT 9.520 Statistical Learning Theory and Applications (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nPABKIuYKo&list=PLyGKBDfnk-iB4Xz_EAJNEgGF5I-6OzRNI)\nStanford Convex Optimization (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLq1hEq3UY&list=PL3940DD956CDF0622)\nCMU Statistical Machine Learning (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1cSby8ZzhA&list=PLjbUi5mgii6B7A0nM74zHTOVQtTC9DaCv) (as a supplement to 9.520)\n\nIf you find the statistical learning part too difficult, don’t skip it. MIT CBMM hosts a workshop called RegML. It’s a bootcamp sort of thing. They go through the statistics in a really short time and it’s easier. Look it up!\n\nCMU Deep Learning (just the beginning. I found it too slow) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oqpax2Q2hc&list=PLp-0K3kfddPzCnS4CqKphh-zT3aDwybDe)\nTODO: CS234 - Reinforcement Learning (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgzM3zpZ55o&list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u)\nTODO: CS330 - Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rZtSwNOTQo&list=PLoROMvodv4rMC6zfYmnD7UG3LVvwaITY5)\n\n\n\n",
